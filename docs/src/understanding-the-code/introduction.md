## The Code

This section of the documentation provides a general, high-level overview of the Formulaic codebase beyond that provided in comments within the source code itself.

First of all, when looking through the codebase you will want to start with `index.php`, which includes the routing logic, and `include/all.php`, which provides a commented list of the included PHP files.

You may want to learn more about some of the more important concepts and interfaces used in the code. If so, go to the [Conceptual Overview](conceptual-overview.html).

You may also want to learn more about how individual routes work. If so, go to the [Route Flowcharts](route-flowcharts.html) page.
